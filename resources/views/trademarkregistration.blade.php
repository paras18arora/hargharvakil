						  Intellectual property is the intangible property of a company which forms a major asset to the company but requires great caution in protecting the same. Trademarks, copyrights and patents are kinds of intellectual property. A trademark is a recognizable sign, design or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others. The trademark owner can be an individual, business organization, or any legal entity. It is an important recognition of your brand and represents the same in the market.<br> 
First of all, a trademark search is conducted with respect to the 45 classes of marks which are basically categories of marks in accordance to the product. Once the mark is approved by our team or is suggested some changes for easier approval, the process goes to the next step. An application for the same will be filed now at the Trade Marks Office and you are usually given the permission to the use ™ sign along with the mark for which the application was applied once it is filed.  Registration for the same might take a long time since it is then published in the journal for any objections and raised objections are heard. Once all the process is cleared and the mark gets registered, the ® symbol can be used with the applied mark. <br>
For start-ups specifically, trademark filing is a necessity since it is all about protecting the idea and all forms of its representations. The name, logo and even the style in which the name is to be written should always be protected by the law so as to avoid infringement and violation of rights. Trademark applications can also be filed in the name of founders in case of start-ups keeping in mind the nature of their businesses which makes it easier for ventures.
