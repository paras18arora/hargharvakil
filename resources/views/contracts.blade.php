						  A contract is a written or spoken agreement regarding an obligation that has to be enforceable by law. Two entities set out mutual rights, responsibilities, and other rules towards each other, usually regarding employment, tenancy, sales, etc. <br>
A written contract provides more certainty to the involved parties, and thus holds much more weight than its verbal counterpart. From a legal perspective, spoken words are flimsy, and by putting an agreement in writing, you’re minimizing the risk of being double-crossed or violating the terms yourself. It’s the best way to dodge misinterpretations and misunderstandings; and even if both parties have honest intentions, details of an agreement can easily get forgotten if they have not been jotted down.<br>
In the case of a dispute, verbal contracts could potentially be seen as valid and binding in the court. However, when it comes to your legal standing and peace of mind, it’s a very thin thread to hang by, and you should do it at your own risk.
Not only does a contract state the expectations of both parties, it also has to foresee how possible problems and negative situations will be resolved. Quite understandably, the first and foremost reason why two parties choose to sign a contract is to obtain something.
<br>
Laws can be convoluted and/or extremely expensive, time-consuming affairs, and if in the case of a legal misinterpretation, you can end up being entrapped. This is where we come to your help. Get your Contracts drafted by professionals at Har Ghar Vakil in such a way that the principles contained therein are detailed and comprehensive ones that are particular to your context and that you can easily abide by.
