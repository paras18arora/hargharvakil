						  It is a means of collecting income tax in India, governed under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961. It is managed by the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT) and is part of the Department of Revenue managed by Indian Revenue Service (IRS).<br>

Every person responsible for making payment of nature covered by TDS provisions of Income Tax Act shall be responsible to deduct tax. However in case of payments made under sec. 194A, 194C, 194H, 194I and 194J in respect of individual and HUF, only if the turnover or professional receipt exceeds sum of Rs. 60 lakh or Rs. 15 lakhs respectively.<br>
Tax Deducted at Source was introduced in India to facilitate the payment of tax while receiving the income and it follows the concept of “Pay as you earn”. The objectives of tax deducted at source were to enable the salaried people to pay the tax as they earn every month. This helps the salaried persons in paying the tax in easy instalments and avoids the burden of a lump sum payment. Further objects were to collect the tax at the time of payment of income to various assesses such as contractors and to help spread the tax net wide enough to include persons who might otherwise have evaded taxes..  Hence, it is very vital to make all the persons earning the taxable income pay the tax. But, the best way to make them pay is to deduct tax at source.
