						  Partnership a legal form of business operation between two or more individuals who share management and profits .If your business will be owned and operated by several individuals, you'll want to take a look at structuring your business as a partnership. Partnerships come in two varieties: general partnerships and limited partnerships. In a general partnership, the partners manage the company and assume responsibility for the partnership's debts and other obligations.
                          <br> A limited partnership has both general and limited partners. The general partners own and operate the business and assume liability for the partnership, while the limited partners serve as investors only; they have no control over the company and are not subject to the same liabilities as the general partners. A partnership allows for a fluid governing structure. Partnerships -- not being fully separated from their owners -- can fluidly move assets in and out of the business. Partnerships themselves don't actually pay taxes. Their profits and losses are passed through to their owners, who then incorporate them in their personal income tax. This simplifies the burden on owners. If you decide to organize your business as a partnership, be sure you draft a partnership agreement that details how business decisions are made, how disputes are resolved and how to handle a buyout. We help you draft your partnership agreement so that if for some reason you run into difficulties with one of the partners or if someone wants out of the arrangement, decisions can be made according to that agreement.
