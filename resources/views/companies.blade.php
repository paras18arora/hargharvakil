						  A company is an entity that has a separate legal existence from its owners. The owners of the company are known as members or shareholders. A company can be defined as an "artificial person", invisible, intangible, created by or under law, with a discrete legal personality, perpetual succession, and a common seal. It is not affected by the death, insanity, or insolvency of an individual member. Its legal status gives a company the same rights as a natural person which means that a company can incur debt, sue and be sued. Companies are managed by company officers who are called directors and company secretaries. <br>
Companies are of various types, for example, Private limited company and One Person Company. Every form of company has a different structure and has different procedures for their incorporation. There are a number of formalities and requirements which have to be complied with very carefully.
