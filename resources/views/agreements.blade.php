						  An agreement is any arrangement or understanding between two or more parties about their rights and responsibilities with respect to one another. Here the terms of the agreement relies upon the honor of the parties involved rather than exterior means of enforcement by law. There should be mutual acceptance by both the parties involved. An agreement can be written or oral both and validity of an agreement does not depend upon consideration involved unlike contracts.
An agreement usually lacks one or more of the essential elements that are required to be present in order to form a valid contract that will be considered legally enforceable by a court of law.
<br>
Contracts outline the terms of the relationship that should be formed between the two parties to the contract. An agreement also outlines the terms of the relationship between the two. However, the difference is that the contractâ€™s outline is far more rigid than that of a contract.<br>

The essential difference between an agreement and a contract is that typically an agreement will only modify a contract that is already in place but does not place an obligation on either one of the parties to provide consideration to the other party, which a contract requires. A contract can involve the exchange of promises between the parties to the contract, while an agreement may simply involve one party accepting the offer from another party.<br>
