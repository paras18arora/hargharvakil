						  A patent is a kind of reward to an inventor who uses his intellect to create something which is novice, an invention and has an industrial application. It confers exclusive rights on the patent holder to use and exploit the same. It is authorized by the State and is for a limited period of time. <br>
Thus this is the best technique for all the inventors to protect their rights when they invent or create something new and want to protect the same. The procedure for grant of patent is a lengthy procedure which involves cautious drafting and financial resources but the same is worth it because an invention can never be priced at the expenses incurred for its patent.<br>
Whenever an inventor seeks to a patent for an invention, the foremost thing to be done is a patent search. There should be no prior art or any invention similar to the invention and the purpose of a patent search is to ensure that the patent is not an imitation or infringement of a product by searching the patent database. <br>
Affirming the novelty of the product, a patent search helps in deciding the scope of protection that can be granted and it determines the novelty of the product to be patented. There are many strategies for patent search and they shall all be taken care of by our experts. <br>
A patent expires after 20 years and comes into the public domain thereafter. The territory for the same would be India only but the application can also be filed in other countries in accordance to the Patent Cooperation Treaty within 12 months of filing in the home country. This enables the patentee to arrange funds since a patent might be a costly affair. We promise to deliver our services at the best possible price because we value the rights an inventor shall be granted and will out in our best for the same.
